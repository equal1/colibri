# Colibri: A Framework for Automated Quantum Dot Calibration

## Overview
Colibri, named after the hummingbird genus and serving as a playful pun on "calibration," aims to provide a comprehensive solution for the calibration of quantum dots. Recognizing the challenges and limitations of manual tuning and script-based approaches, our planned framework leverages machine learning algorithms to automate the tasks of creation, initialization, and control of quantum dotsâ€”critical steps for advancing scalability.
