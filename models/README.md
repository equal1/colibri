# models
## Description
Here we store the models that we use for our project.
In the intermediary_models/ folder we store localy all non-final models that we use for our project.

IMPORTANT: ONLY THE MODELS THAT ARE USED IN COLIBRI FRAMEWORK SHOULD BE PUSHED TO GIT.

TODO: We really need to find a way to store the models in a more efficient way(probably in a dedicated server) and as soon as possible.
